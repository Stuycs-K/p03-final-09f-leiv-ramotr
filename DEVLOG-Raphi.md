### 2026-01-05 - Planning
Spent class deciding which project to attempt and filling out the proposal document.

### 2026-01-06 - Networking with sockets
Pasted old files for networking and server/client connections. Changed files to work properly and tested across multiple computers.

### 2026-01-07 - Select
Added select in the server file to read from listening_socket and stdin. It will read a buffer from stdin and send to a function that handles the game. It will add any new clients to a list where they get matched.

### 2026-01-08 - Client Logic
Set up matchmaking function in server and did most of client logic to have a game with another client.
