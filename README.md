### Project Description:

This project is a Tic Tac Toe Game using what we learned in Stuyvesant's System Level Programming class. Coded using C, you can connect to a server, be matched with a random player, or play against your friend on the same computer. Enjoy!!

### Instructions:
Enter ./client to begin play. You will be prompted to choose whether to play locally or online against a random player. If you choose to play locally, it will begin the game as described below. If you choose online, you will have to input the IP address of the server or simply press enter if it is on the same computer (to create a server, enter ./server on a new window). It will then wait until another player connects to the server and will match you up.

You can return to the home menu at any time by entering "home". You can leave the game at any time with ctrl+c.

The game is played as follows:

1. Once connected to an opponent, you will be given either X's or O's. X always goes first.
2. To play the game, type the coordinates of an empty box.
    Top (T), Middle(M), Bottom (B), Left (L), Right(R)  
    | TL | TM | TR |  
    |----|----|----|
    | ML | MM | MR |  
    | BL | BM | BR |  
3. If already taken, you will be prompted to choose a different spot.
4. Wait for your opponent's turn and repeat.
5. Have your pieces three in a row, column, or diagonal to win.
6. If you are playing online, when the game is over, you will have the option to play again with the same client play with a new opponent, or return to the home menu.
7. If your opponent leaves, you will be sent to the queue to wait for a new opponent. If the server disconnects, you will be sent to the home menu.\n");
8. If you are playing locally, you can play again or return home by typing \'home\'. after the game ends \n");
9. If you want to return to the home menu anytime during the game, you can just type 'home'.
