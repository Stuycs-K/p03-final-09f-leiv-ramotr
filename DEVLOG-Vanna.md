### 2026-01-06 - Wrote Proposal and Setup Project
Raphi and I discussed our plans for the project and wrote down our goals, expectations, and distributions of roles. This took appox. half a period. We added the necessary files and set up our branches and DEVLOGs. Started the game outputs after a client has connected.

### 2026-01-07 - Finished Readme and worked on the game features; made gameboard; user commands
Worked on beginning print statements and game board; an error we have is the input of the client. "no" ends the game, but "on" doesn't. As long as the first letter is y or n, it works.
Finished README and printed gameboard.
Goes through input from user. Ex. types BR and board is reprinted with bottom right changed. Took approx. an hour

### 2026-01-08 - Worked on game mechanics; finished win/draw mechanics
Fixed notation so that it switches players (could only be played locally for now). Repeats.
Added win and draw mechanics and fixed if there were any repeats in moves. (if move is valid.) spent a lil more than an hour.

### 2026-01-09 - Game Logic w/ local play
Worked with Raphi on his computer to created local play and test the game. Made a way to return to main menu. Added clearer instructions.

### 2026-01-11 - Added game manual
When user types help, a manual will be printed.

### 2026-01-13 - Wrote Script
Discussed with Raphi next steps and then I worked on the script for the video.
