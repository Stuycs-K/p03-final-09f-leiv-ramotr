### 2026-01-06 - Wrote Proposal and Setup Project
Raphi and I discussed our plans for the project and wrote down our goals, expectations, and distributions of roles. This took appox. half a period. We added the necessary files and set up our branches and DEVLOGs. Started the game outputs after a client has connected.

### 2026-01-07 - Finished Readme and worked on the game features; made gameboard  
Worked on beginning print statements and game board; an error we have is the input of the client. "no" ends the game, but "on" doesn't. As long as the first letter is y or n, it works.
Finished README and printing gameboard
