### Systems Video Script

[Raphi] Hi. We're the Five Tea Chicken from Tennessee in PD 9 for Systems Level Programming. I'm Raphi.
[Vanna] And I'm Vanna. For the Final Project, we created Tic Tac Toe Tomatetoe Tomauto.

Before we begin, if you want to follow along, you can get all our code from the repository linked above and play with a friend. *points in a direction*.

[Raphi] Okay, so once you have everything, you can type ./client to enter the game. You will be given the option to either 1) play locally or with a friend on your computer or 2) play online, or with someone from a different computer. We're going to start with the local demonstration.

[Vanna] Yeah so I'm gonna type 1 for locally. Oh wow, the board opened.

[Raphi] In order to move, you type one of the coordinates of the tile. If you type help, the manual opens and if you look right here, you can see what each tile is. So TR for top right corner, MM, for middle box, etc. Top, Right, Left, and Middle.

[Vanna] play. I'm going to go TR. Now my imaginary friend right next to me wants to go MM. *speeds up until the end*. Oh no! I lost! I want a rematch.

[Raphi] How do you lose to an imaginary friend? Anyways, just press enter to play again.

[Vanna] Okay. I'm gonna win this time. *speeds up until the end* Aw man it's a draw. One more time!
*press enter and plays again until the end* YAY I win. Okay this is getting boring. How do I play with you?

[Raphi] Type home to go back to the main menu. You can type home and help anytime to go back to the main menu or open the manual.  

[Vanna] okay. *types home* Okay, so I just type 2 to go online right.
[Raphi] Yeah. You will be prompted to enter the IP address of the server you are joining to. If the server is local, press enter to wait to connect. If there is no server open, the connection will close.

[Vanna] I see. And I can just type home if I'm tired of waiting. Okay I'm going to play online. What's your server adress.

[Raphi] Server address

[Vanna] Connects.

[Raphi] *Opens server and client and connect*

[Vanna] So it's my turn. I'm gonna go XX.

[Raphi] Okay I'm gonna go XX

*speeds up*

[Vanna] I think I'm losing. I don't want to play anymore. *exits*
[Raphi] Wait!!
[Vanna] Oops too late. But it looks like you can just wait for a new opponent

[Raphi] or just play with my imaginary friend right. Join again

[Vanna] okay fine. *opens client*

*plays a game*

[Vanna] Aw man I still lost anyways. I don't want to play with you anymore.
